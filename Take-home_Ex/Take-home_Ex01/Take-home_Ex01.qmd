# Project Overview

This project aims to provide an in-depth study of the performance of Singapore students in mathematics, reading and science through appropriate exploratory data analysis (EDA) methods and ggplot2 functions.

Through analysis of the 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) data, we will explore the distribution of these performances and try to understand possible relationships between these performances and schools, student gender, and socioeconomic status.

The project aims to provide insight into possible disparities and trends in Singapore's education system, leading to more in-depth studies of these disparities or references for future policy decisions.

# Data preparation

## Loading R packages

In this take-home exercise, some R packages will be used. They are:

-   [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and

-   [haven](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and

-   [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

The code chunk used is as follows:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, haven, ggplot2, patchwork, dplyr)
```

## Importing PISA data

Download the Student Questionnaire data file from the PISA 2022 database and import it.

The code chunk below uses [`read_sas()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/read_sas.html) of [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) to import PISA data into R environment.

```{r}
# eval: false
stu_qqq <- read_sas("data/cy08msp_stu_qqq.sas7bdat")

```

And filtering out Singapore students in the data.

```{r}
# eval: false
stu_qqq_SG <- stu_qqq %>% 
  filter(CNT =="SGP")
```

```{r}
# eval: false
write_rds(stu_qqq_SG,
          "data/stu_qqq_SG.rds")
```

```{r}
stu_qqq_SG <- 
read_rds("data/stu_qqq_SG.rds")
```

Select related to math, reading and science student performance data, as well as schools, gender, and socioeconomic status of related data.

```{r}
# eval: false
Related_math_read_scie_data <- stu_qqq_SG %>%
  select(contains(c("ID","ST004D01T","math", "read", "scie","ST259Q01JA","ST259Q02JA","ST005Q01JA","ST007Q01JA")))

```

```{r}
# eval: false
write_rds(Related_math_read_scie_data,
          "data/Related_math_read_scie_data.rds")
```

```{r}
Related_math_read_scie_data <- 
read_rds("data/Related_math_read_scie_data.rds")
```

## Data about Maths/Read/Science

Calculate the average of PV1-10 Maths/Read/Science, representing each student's ability to perform maths/Read/Science.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
Related_math_read_scie_data <- Related_math_read_scie_data %>%
  mutate(avg_pvMATH = rowMeans(select(., ends_with("Math")), na.rm = TRUE))

Related_math_read_scie_data <- Related_math_read_scie_data %>%
  mutate(avg_pvREAD = rowMeans(select(., ends_with("READ")), na.rm = TRUE))

Related_math_read_scie_data <- Related_math_read_scie_data %>%
  mutate(avg_pvSCIE = rowMeans(select(., ends_with("SCIE")), na.rm = TRUE))

Related_math_read_scie_data %>%
  select(CNTSCHID, CNTSTUID,avg_pvMATH, avg_pvREAD, avg_pvSCIE) %>%
  head(5)
```

## Plotting a simple bar chart

We first looked at the data in general to see the overall distribution of math, reading, and science average plausible values. Through visualization methods such as histograms and box graphs, we have clarified the range of students' performance in various subjects.

### Maths/Read/Science Distributions

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

p1 <- ggplot(data=Related_math_read_scie_data, aes(x = avg_pvMATH)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="black", 
                 fill="grey") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(avg_pvMATH)), color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  annotate("text", x = median(Related_math_read_scie_data$avg_pvMATH), y = 30, 
           label = paste("Median:", round(median(Related_math_read_scie_data$avg_pvMATH), 2)), 
           vjust = 1, color = "red") +
  labs(y = "Count")

p2 <- ggplot(data=Related_math_read_scie_data, aes(x = avg_pvREAD)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="black", 
                 fill="grey") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(avg_pvREAD)), color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  annotate("text", x = median(Related_math_read_scie_data$avg_pvREAD), y = 30, 
           label = paste("Median:", round(median(Related_math_read_scie_data$avg_pvREAD), 2)), 
           vjust = 1, color = "red") +
  labs(y = "Count")

p3 <- ggplot(data=Related_math_read_scie_data, aes(x = avg_pvSCIE)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="black", 
                 fill="grey") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(avg_pvSCIE)), color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  annotate("text", x = median(Related_math_read_scie_data$avg_pvSCIE), y = 30, 
           label = paste("Median:", round(median(Related_math_read_scie_data$avg_pvSCIE), 2)), 
           vjust = 1, color = "red") +
  labs(y = "Count")

p1 + p2 + p3 +
  plot_layout(guides = "collect") +
  plot_annotation(title = "Distributions of Maths/Reading/Science with Median Lines", tag_levels = "I")
```

#### Insights from Visualisations by Distributions

Analyzing average Plausible Values for math (250-850), reading (150-800), and science (200-850),respectively. The median math mean confidence was 582.41, meaning that about half of the students had an average confidence of less than or greater than 582.41. Similar trends exist in reading and science. The median reading average confidence was 553.63. The median scientific average confidence value is 571.24. These medians are an important indicator of where the average performance is.

### The Relationship between Gender and Performances

In general, gender coding conventions, 1 means male and 2 means female.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
p4 <- ggplot(data = Related_math_read_scie_data, aes(x = avg_pvMATH, fill = factor(ST004D01T))) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, color = "grey30", position = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "avg_pvMATH", y = "Count", fill = "Gender") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("skyblue", "pink"))

p5 <- ggplot(data = Related_math_read_scie_data, aes(x = avg_pvREAD, fill = factor(ST004D01T))) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, color = "grey30", position = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "avg_pvREAD", y = "Count", fill = "Gender") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("skyblue", "pink"))

p6 <- ggplot(data = Related_math_read_scie_data, aes(x = avg_pvSCIE, fill = factor(ST004D01T))) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, color = "grey30", position = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "avg_pvSCIE", y = "Count", fill = "Gender") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("skyblue", "pink"))

p4 + p5 + p6 +
  plot_layout(guides = "collect") +
  plot_annotation(title = "The Relationship between Gender and Performances", tag_levels = "I")
```

#### Insights the Relationship between Maths/Read/Science Performances and Gender

Gender-related insights from visualizations show variations in Plausible Values. In mathematics, boys exhibit higher values before around 610, with girls dominating afterward. In reading, girls perform better in the lower range (before 600), while boys excel in the higher range (after 600). Similarly, in science, boys show higher values before about 590, and girls dominate afterward, indicating differing gender performance levels across subjects.

### The Relationship between School and Performances

When using "avg_pvMATH", "avg_pvREAD", "avg_pvREAD" values for all students in a school, it is difficult to get an accurate picture of the relative strengths and weaknesses of each school's score distribution due to the large number of schools and students involved.

Therefore, we average the "avg_pvMATH" of all students in each school to get the school's "avg_pvMATH_school". In this way we can get a clearer picture of the impact of school on the relationship between performance and school.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
Related_math_read_scie_data <- Related_math_read_scie_data %>% 
  group_by(CNTSCHID) %>%
  mutate(avg_pvMATH_school = mean(avg_pvMATH, na.rm = TRUE))

Related_math_read_scie_data <- Related_math_read_scie_data %>% 
  group_by(CNTSCHID) %>%
  mutate(avg_pvREAD_school = mean(avg_pvREAD, na.rm = TRUE))

Related_math_read_scie_data <- Related_math_read_scie_data %>% 
  group_by(CNTSCHID) %>%
  mutate(avg_pvSCIE_school = mean(avg_pvSCIE, na.rm = TRUE))

Related_math_read_scie_data %>%
  select(CNTSCHID, CNTSTUID,avg_pvMATH_school, avg_pvREAD_school, avg_pvSCIE_school) %>%
  head(5)
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
p7 <- ggplot(data = Related_math_read_scie_data, 
             aes(x = CNTSCHID, 
                 y = avg_pvMATH_school)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(formula = y~x, method = lm, 
              size = 0.5) +  
  labs(x = "School ID", y = "Average PV Maths")

p8 <- ggplot(data = Related_math_read_scie_data, 
             aes(x = CNTSCHID, 
                 y = avg_pvREAD_school)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(formula = y~x, method = lm, 
              size = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "School ID", y = "Average PV Read")

p9 <- ggplot(data = Related_math_read_scie_data, 
             aes(x = CNTSCHID, 
                 y = avg_pvSCIE_school)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(formula = y~x, method = lm, 
              size = 0.5) +  
  labs(x = "School ID", y = "Average PV Scie")

p7 + p8 + p9 +
    plot_layout(guides = "collect") +
  plot_annotation(title = "The Relationship between School and Performances", tag_levels = "I")
```

#### Insights the Relationship between Maths/Read/Science Performances and School ID

Using this scatter plot, we notice a decreasing trend in average performance in math, reading, and science for school numbers ranging from 70200001 to 70200165. This shows that whether it is math, reading or science, the students in school 70200001 are the best, and it decreases all the way to school 70200165, which is the students in school 70200165 are the worst.

### The Relationship between Socioeconomic Status and Performances

-   [Computer-Based Student Questionnaire for Pisa 2022 - Main Survey Version](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2022database/CY8_202111_QST_MS_STQ_CBA_NoNotes.pdf)

![](images/clipboard-2399481357.png){width="501"}

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
Related_math_read_scie_data %>%
  select(CNTSCHID, CNTSTUID, ST259Q01JA, ST259Q02JA) %>%
  head(5)
```

According to this questionnaire report, we can filter out "ST259Q01JA" and "ST259Q02JA", two columns of data that can reflect a person's socioeconomic status. But in these two columns, there is no specific data, so we cannot judge the relationship between socioeconomic status and performances.

So let's do it another way. We filter out "ST005Q01JA","ST007Q01JA". It is assumed that families with highly educated parents will have a good socioeconomic status.

![](images/clipboard-2172285159.png){width="436"}

![](images/clipboard-2120473943.png){width="433"}

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

Related_math_read_scie_data <- Related_math_read_scie_data %>%
  mutate(Parent_Edu_level = ST005Q01JA + ST007Q01JA)

head(Related_math_read_scie_data[, c("CNTSCHID", "CNTSTUID", "ST005Q01JA", "ST007Q01JA", "Parent_Edu_level")])
```

We add these two columns together to get a new column "Parent_Edu_level", which ranges from 1 to 10, the smaller the number, the higher the education of the parents.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
df <- Related_math_read_scie_data

ggplot(df, aes(x = Parent_Edu_level)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = avg_pvMATH, color = "Math"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = avg_pvMATH, color = "Math"), method = "lm", se = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_point(aes(y = avg_pvREAD, color = "Read"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = avg_pvREAD, color = "Read"), method = "lm", se = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_point(aes(y = avg_pvSCIE, color = "Science"), na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = avg_pvSCIE, color = "Science"), method = "lm", se = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Performance and Socioeconomic Status",
       x = "Socioeconomic Status (Lower values indicate higher status)",
       y = "Average PV Score") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Math" = "blue", "Read" = "green", "Science" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Insights the Relationship between Maths/Read/Science Performances and Socioeconomic Status

Through this graph, we can observe that students from families of higher socioeconomic status achieve significantly better grades in all subjects than those from families of lower socioeconomic status.

# Conclusion

Analyzing Plausible Values (math: 250-850, reading: 150-800, science: 200-850) revealed median scores of 582.41 for math, 553.63 for reading, and 571.24 for science, indicating central performance levels.

Gender-wise, boys dominate in math before 610, girls lead in reading below 600, and in science, boys excel before 590. Notably, girls outperform in science after this point.

The scatter plot reveals a consistent decline in average performance across math, reading, and science from school 70200001 to 70200165.

Higher socioeconomic status correlates with superior academic performance across all subjects.
